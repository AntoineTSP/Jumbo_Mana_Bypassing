## Learning RL Theory

The RL framework I'll use : https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3 \\
Its documentation : https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html \\
Its tutorial : https://github.com/araffin/rl-tutorial-jnrr19 \\

Hugging Face Course (the one that inspired what I've done) : https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction \\
Its tutorial without Deep Learning : https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit2/hands-on \\
Its tutorial with Deep Learning : https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit3/hands-on \\
